The Porting Effort

In porting the code, we let errors and warnings of compiles and runs (test codes,
main openev, etc.) guide us.  When problems were found, changes were formulated
and applied to all problematic files.  While we eliminated all of the errors
that our testing touched, many warnings still remain.  Most of these are GTK
deprecation warnings.  We tested the code as fully as possible, but we expect
that some portions of code have not been covered at all.  We also expect minor
bugs to be flushed out for some months to come.

In testing, we have not pushed the system very hard.  It could use some testing
on large images, 3D stuff, opening and closing of view areas, etc.  It is by
no means bullet proof, but it works reasonably well.

Before releasing to the public
    - Check for unnecessary debug print statements
    - Remove unnecessary files and other test scaffolding
    - Update copyright section in each file if necessary
    - Create a README and CHANGELOG file
    - Create an openev-devel mailing list for development related traffic;
      the openev list should contain only usage related traffic
    - Establish coding stylistic conventions
        - Python style guide is a good place to start
        - Make it consistent with our internal development standards
        - Jeff C. has already started such a document
    - Clean up build / installation procedures for multiple platforms,
      autoconf?
    - Web site changes, marketing blurbs, explanation of why switching
      to the gtk2 version is beneficial
    - Detail how we plan on addressing issues mentioned on the list,
      including large vectors, will we use new 2d graphics capabilities,
      can we improve menus and tools using gtk Actions and UIManager, etc.
    - Update documentation / tutorials

Things yet to be done to clean up the source.  Let's get the community to
help.

    - Replace or upgrade pgu*.py with gtk equivalents (pgucolor.ColorButton
        has already been ported)
    - Rename pygtk names using the fully qualified gtk namespace 
        (import gtk, not from gtk import ...)
        This is important, since the Gtk prefix has been dropped from all names
        in PyGtk-2.x.
    - Old fonts -> Pango fonts
    - Use the warnings as a guide to potential future problems, esp. DeprecationWarnings
    - Reorganize openev/pymod into a tree of packages
    - gview.py and other modules are too big; break out into a seperate package
    - Factor out unnecessary modules -- it looks like there might be some gdal
      modules that are already available in the gdal distribution
    - Verify with pychecker and code coverage tools
    - Finish porting tools -- need to find replacements for GtkExtra
