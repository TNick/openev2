Thinking about (Gillian):

* Update Open Raw to use VRT (optionally?) instead of Paux so that binary 
  files with more data types can be opened.  This would possibly require 
  updates to the VRT format.

* Line of interest (LOI) tool and possibly a general polygon Area of 
  interest (AOI) tool similar to existing POI/ROI tools.
  LOI: Should have "changing" (new node added to incomplete line) and 
  "changed" signals (line has been completed by right clicking, or an 
  already complete line has been modified).  Should allow one line.  Once 
  a line is complete, should behave like node edit tool (allow moving nodes 
  or adding new nodes) except that left clicking that doesn't fall on the 
  line should start a new loi and delete the old one.  Tool should not 
  require a shape layer.

* Add linestyles with points at nodes only to methods of drawing lines
  (follow ogr spec).

* Graphical tool for combining files into a single dataset, splitting a
  dataset into several files, importing ground control points into a 
  dataset, adding a colourtable or metadata, reprojecting existing 
  geocoding information (not resampling- just reprojecting gcp's). 
  Basically, a tool for manipulating VRT's without the user having to 
  know so much about them.

Would like to have (Frank):

* The Tabular Shapes Attribute Grid Demo should have the ability to 
  edit the attributes added, and it should move into the Edit menu to
  replace the existing crappy Vector Layer Attributes dialog.  It should
  also likely report the layer it is displaying somewhere on the dialog. 

Short-term (Andrey)

* Tool for manual image enchancements (both for the whole image and
  in the ROI area)

* GUI to edit geocoding information

* `Open Sub-area' dialog.

Long-term (Andrey)

* Vector layer reprojection.

* Image calibration.

* GUI frontend for GDAL warping interface.

* GUI for image registration.

* Filter tool.

* Spectral plots, profile plots.

* Angle measurement.

* Image classification, pixel editor, pseudocolor table editor.

Old to-do list (Sept. 2000)

-*-mode: text; mode: auto-fill-*-

* ROI mode shouldn't stop showing roi when user clicks in a
  different window.

* Select mode should be able to select from any layer ... perhaps
  based on a setup option.

* Line tool: continue existing line if the first click is over
an end vertex.

* toolbox: preserve selection state across certain tools

* Select tool: it's easy to accidentally translate a line when you
just want to select it.  Possibly add some kind of sensitivity
measure, e.g. no translation if only one motion event recieved.

* Tools: should use the view draw signal to invoke a draw instead of
connecting to the layer draw method?  Or make the base tool class
handle this somehow?

* View area: change cursor when panning/rotating/scaling.

* Undo: add redo capablility.

* Node tool: Add and drag a new node is entered as two operations to
undo.  This might be more intuative as one compound operation.
